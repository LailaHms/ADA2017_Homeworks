    "# Geocoding Tweets  With The Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to create the mapping dictionaries used to recover the tweets that were pickled and to map them to a specific country. The tweets were recovered with their location (when provided by the user). If the tweet did not have a provided location, the location of the user was scraped. However not all users provide this information on their page. That is why all the tweets which did not have either information were dropped. Then the locations provided were mapped to the countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To map the tweets to their locations we used in order : \n",
    "- Automatic verification of whether the country name or a capital name was contained in the string. This was possible using the data obtained from : https://mledoze.github.io/countries/ and https://datahub.io/core/country-codes. The first links the country iso codes to country names in multiple languages with not only the official but also the common names of a country. The latter links the country iso codes to country names in different languages (arabic, chinese, english, spanish, french, russian). \n",
    "- A city to country mapper from which we removed duplicate cities taken from : https://github.com/lutangar/cities.json \n",
    "- A city to country mapper extracted from : http://www.geonames.org/export/ and http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/. The issue with this dataframe is that the duplicate cities were not handled. They were progressively overwritten. The advantage of this mapper however is that it is more extensive than the previous one, contaning a larger number of cities as well as alternative spellings and different languages. Ideally, what should have been done in the case of multiple cities with same name would be to select based on the population of the cities. \n",
    "- If none of the above yielded any results we queried an API based on the works of http://www.geonames.org/export/, http://geocoder.readthedocs.io/results.html which outputs the most probable location to which the user selected location corresponds to. From that we can recover the ISO country code which can directly be used in the Chloropleth maps. Note that we could not query the API for all the locations as this takes around 1 second per tweet. Given that the number of tweets is in the order of magnitude of the millions this would not have been feasible on the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this was done using dictionaries to speed up the identification process. Currently, for pickles containing around 2000 tweets, we require under 10 seconds of processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create the dictionaries the given locations were set as keys with alternative spellings as well as string formatting to maximize the chance of identifying the country. What is time consuming however is creating the dictionaries themselves which is why the dictionaries were pickled once the process was finished. "
