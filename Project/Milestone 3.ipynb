    "Major events happen on a regular basis all around the world, some involving high number of casualties but the resulting reaction on the international scale is often far from proportional. Most of the time the largest reaction comes from the place where the incident occurred or places which are closeby. The objective would be to create an awareness map, and determine why people react to an event. From that we would attempt to define an awareness metric. We want to see how factors other than physical proximity come into play such as country, culture, language, religion. With this we could determine which country has the highest level of international awareness. The project would require the Twitter API to acquire hashtag specific tweets with geolocation and therefore measure the awareness and reactions of different communities to a given event. GDELT would be used to recover standardised information regarding different events.\n",

    "## 1.1 Tweet Acquisition\n",
    "A lot of time was spent acquiring the Tweets for two main reasons : \n",
    "- The Twitter dump did not contain the geolocations of the tweets or the users. \n",
    "- The Twitter API does not permit the recovery of tweets which are over 1 week old when searching for tweets with a given hashtag around a specific date. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is why a significant amount of time was put into recovering the tweets through webscraping using phantom js with random scrolling time and random breaks to avoid being blocked by Twitter.\n",

    "## 1.2. Tweet Geolocalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the tweets were recovered we only kept those for which we had either the geolocalisation of the tweets itself or of the user. As the locations are manually input, they are not standardized and the corresponding location needed to be determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was therefore to format the strings by removing all special characters as setting everything to lower case for example.  Afterwards, we created multiple mappings which were used in the order presented as they represent the confidence in the given method : \n",
    "- A country mapper which uses multiple variations of the country name (different spellings and languages) to determine the country it corresponds to with the given ISO2 code\n",
    "- A capital mapper which maps the capital of a country to the ISO2 code\n",
    "- A first city mapper where duplicates were removed as there are multiple cities in the world with the same name (example : Torronto in Canada, the US and Australia). \n",
    "- A final city mapper with all the cities of all the countries in the world using the database provided here **(TODO : mettre le lien)**\n",

    "- binary : if two countries have the same official language then they are linked\n",
    "- more informed : some languages are similar in the sense of understanding the other language, learning it, etc. That is why we wanted to take into account Linguistic distances. Unfortunately this is a current research topic and there is no database which gives the Linguistic distances between all the official languages of all countries. Certain databases exist linking English to other languages but this is not sufficient for our application. That is why we decided to use another metric, albeit more abstact, which is to say the phylogenetic trees linking languages together. \n",
