    "Major events happen on a regular basis all around the world, some involving high number of casualties but the resulting reaction on the international scale is often far from proportional. Most of the time the largest reaction comes from the place where the incident occurred or places which are closeby. The objective would be to create an awareness map, and determine why people react to an event. From that we would attempt to define an awareness metric. We want to see how factors other than physical proximity come into play such as country, culture, language, religion. With this we could determine which country has the highest level of international awareness. The project would require the Twitter API to acquire hashtag specific tweets with geolocation and therefore measure the awareness and reactions of different communities to a given event. GDELT would be used to recover standardised information regarding different events.\n",

    "A lot of time was spent acquiring the Tweets for two main reasons : \n",
    "- The Twitter dump did not contain the geolocations of the tweets or the users and only containecd 10% of all tweets for a given period. Given that users to not necessarily give their location we wanted to avoid cases where we would not have enough overall located tweets. \n",

At the time of Milestone 2 we would just go through the complete mapping sequentially and stop at the first match.

That is why we corrected the mapping to take into account the population of the different cities which was also provided in the GeoNames database http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/.

    "Distance tends to play an important role in determining people's interest regarding a specific event. But there are several types of distances which can be considered when speaking of countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most evident is the **birds-eye-view distance** between the countries. This is computed based on the positions of the center of each country. But this is not enough. Take for example the US and Canada, the distance between the center of thees two countries is much larger than the distance between France and any of its neighboring countries. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relative Importance of Neighbors** :  To take into account the fact that two countries can be neighbors and still have a big distance between them we decided to create a metric which would give importance to countries which are direct neighbors. We also wanted to make sure to give each neighbor the importance it is due. For example France has  multiple countries at its border. But that does not mean that each of these countries are of similar importance. That is why we weighted this metric by the size of the countries. Therefore a small neighboring country such as Luxemburg would have a smaller weight than Germany for example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hop Distance** : This second metric accounts not only for direct neighbors but also for the smallest number of countries which would need to be traversed to connect any two countries in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flight Routes** : This last metric accounts for movement of populations between the different countries. The assumption is that the existence of flight routes is due to the fact that people exhibit a certain interest for the other country. The more often you visit a place, the more likely you are to be interested in what is going on there. \n",
