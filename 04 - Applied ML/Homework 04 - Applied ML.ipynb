    "## Question 1: Propensity score matching\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will apply [propensity score matching](http://www.stewartschultz.com/statistics/books/Design%20of%20observational%20studies.pdf), which we discussed in lecture 5 (\"Observational studies\"), in order to draw conclusions from an observational study.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with a by-now classic dataset from Robert LaLonde's study \"[Evaluating the Econometric Evaluations of Training Programs](http://people.hbs.edu/nashraf/LaLonde_1986.pdf)\" (1986).\n",
    "The study investigated the effect of a job training program (\"National Supported Work Demonstration\") on the real earnings of an individual, a couple of years after completion of the program.\n",
    "Your task is to determine the effectiveness of the \"treatment\" represented by the job training program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset description\n",
    "\n",
    "- `treat`: 1 if the subject participated in the job training program, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `age`: the subject's age\n",
    "- `educ`: years of education\n",
    "- `race`: categorical variable with three possible values: Black, Hispanic, or White\n",
    "- `married`: 1 if the subject was married at the time of the training program, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `nodegree`: 1 if the subject has earned no school degree, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `re74`: real earnings in 1974 (pre-treatment)\n",
    "- `re75`: real earnings in 1975 (pre-treatment)\n",
    "- `re78`: real earnings in 1978 (outcome)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to brush up your knowledge on propensity scores and observational studies, we highly recommend Rosenbaum's excellent book on the [\"Design of Observational Studies\"](http://www.stewartschultz.com/statistics/books/Design%20of%20observational%20studies.pdf). Even just reading the first chapter (18 pages) will help you a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. A naive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the distribution of the outcome variable (`re78`) between the two groups, using plots and numbers.\n",
    "To summarize and compare the distributions, you may use the techniques we discussed in lectures 4 (\"Read the stats carefully\") and 6 (\"Data visualization\").\n",
    "\n",
    "What might a naive \"researcher\" conclude from this superficial analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. A closer look at the data\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not naive, of course (and even if you are, you've learned certain things in ADA), so you aren't content with a superficial analysis such as the above.\n",
    "You're aware of the dangers of observational studies, so you take a closer look at the data before jumping to conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each feature in the dataset, compare its distribution in the treated group with its distribution in the control group, using plots and numbers.\n",
    "As above, you may use the techniques we discussed in class for summarizing and comparing the distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you observe?\n",
    "Describe what your observations mean for the conclusions drawn by the naive \"researcher\" from his superficial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. A propsensity score model\n",
    "\n",
    "Use logistic regression to estimate propensity scores for all points in the dataset.\n",
    "You may use `sklearn` to fit the logistic regression model and apply it to each data point to obtain propensity scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn import linear_model\n",
    "logistic = linear_model.LogisticRegression()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the propensity score of a data point represents its probability of receiving the treatment, based on its pre-treatment features (in this case, age, education, pre-treatment income, etc.).\n",
    "To brush up on propensity scores, you may read chapter 3.3 of the above-cited book by Rosenbaum or [this article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4jctQY-uqhzTlpBaTBJRTJFVFE/view).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you do not need a train/test split here. Train and apply the model on the entire dataset. If you're wondering why this is the right thing to do in this situation, recall that the propensity score model is not used in order to make predictions about unseen data. Its sole purpose is to balance the dataset across treatment groups.\n",
    "(See p. 74 of Rosenbaum's book for an explanation why slight overfitting is even good for propensity scores.\n",
    "If you want even more information, read [this article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4jctQY-uqhzTlpBaTBJRTJFVFE/view).)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Balancing the dataset via matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the propensity scores to match each data point from the treated group with exactly one data point from the control group, while ensuring that each data point from the control group is matched with at most one data point from the treated group.\n",
    "(Hint: you may explore the `networkx` package in Python for predefined matching functions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your matching should maximize the similarity between matched subjects, as captured by their propensity scores.\n",
    "In other words, the sum (over all matched pairs) of absolute propensity-score differences between the two matched subjects should be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "After matching, you have as many treated as you have control subjects.\n",
    "Compare the outcomes (`re78`) between the two groups (treated and control).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, compare again the feature-value distributions between the two groups, as you've done in part 2 above, but now only for the matched subjects.\n",
    "What do you observe?\n",
    "Are you closer to being able to draw valid conclusions now than you were before?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Balancing the groups further\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your comparison of feature-value distributions from part 4, are you fully satisfied with your matching?\n",
    "Would you say your dataset is sufficiently balanced?\n",
    "If not, in what ways could the \"balanced\" dataset you have obtained still not allow you to draw valid conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve your matching by explicitly making sure that you match only subjects that have the same value for the problematic feature.\n",
    "Argue with numbers and plots that the two groups (treated and control) are now better balanced than after part 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. A less naive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the outcomes (`re78`) between treated and control subjects, as you've done in part 1, but now only for the matched dataset you've obtained from part 5.\n",
    "What do you conclude about the effectiveness of the job training program?\n",

    "- *re74*, *re75* and *re78*: earnings for the given year\n",
    "\n",
    "The dtypes and unique values of the columns were verified to make sure that there weren't any suprises along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the data we noticed that there wasn't a white column. This column was added manually and individuals were set to 1 if they were neither black nor hispanic. We also added a race column which would take values B,H,W whether the person was black, hispanic or white.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Naive Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective here was to quickly assess whether having followed the training program had an influence on the salary. Therefore we wanted to compare simply the *re78* for people with and without treatment. For that we used the groupby functionality. To obtain statistical information we used the describe functionality of the dataframes and computed the correlation between having taken the treatment and the salary. We plotted the histograms of the data with treatment, without treatment and overall with a boxplot to explicit certain statistical aspects of the data. We also plotter the boxplots of with and without treatment against one another with a swarmplot to determine where the datapoints lie. All of this was done with multiple functions so that they can be reused in following questions\n",

    "2. Add edges between the nodes from the different partitions using the differences in propensity scores from the previous question\n",
    "3. Used the networkx max_weight_matching algorithm on the bipartite graph in order to find the optimal pairs.\n",

This means that at the time of treatment, most of them are most likely still studying and not looking for jobs. \n",

This is most likely due to the oil crisis which experienced it's first peak around that time ([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis#/media/File:Nominalrealoilprices1968-2006.png)). Their revenues increased significantly by 78 even though they had not participated in the training program. This could also be linked to a drop in the oil prices before the peak in the 80s.\n",

This is coherent with the fact that a majority of these people are young as mentioned previously and not necessarily looking for jobs. Therefore it would be logical to assume that in 78 when a larger fraction of people got jobs that their revenues would increase but that they would be lower than that of the control group where more people had jobs to begin with, especially since the salary is supposed to increase over time.\n",

    "We started by importing the news groups dataset for the scikit learn library. We isolated the data and the target names then we computed the term frequency inverse document frequency for each of the entries. This becomes our matrix of features X. We then split the dataset into training, validation and testing set using `np.split` function. We were careful to have a sparse array at the end in order to speed up the classification with the random forests. It is important to note that there are 170'000 features for 18'000 samples. Therefore it would have been interesting to do a preliminary feature selection before classification.\n",

    "To find the best parameters we ran a grid search as asked, although it would have been faster to run a random search using the scikit learn RandomSearchCV. We chose not to use the GridSearchCV function because the grid search Cv function outputs the solution with the best results while there is often a tradeoff to be made between the number of parameters / computation time and the accuracy. We wanted to be able to select the set of parameters which offered the best compromise which is why we output the results of the grid search in the form of a heatmap before finding the best tradeoff. We then retrained the model with the optimal parameters, did the confusion matrix and assessed the results as well as the features selected.\n"
